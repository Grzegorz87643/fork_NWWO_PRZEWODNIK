            <h2>Paryż</h2>
            <img src="./img/paryż.jpg" alt="">
            <p> Paris, the capital of France, is one of the most iconic and visited cities in the world, known for its
                history, art, architecture, fashion, and culture. Often called the “City of Light” (La Ville Lumière),
                Paris lies along the River Seine in northern France and is famous for its elegant boulevards, historic
                monuments, and vibrant atmosphere.

                Key landmarks include the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Champs-Élysées
                leading to the Arc de Triomphe, and the artistic hilltop district of Montmartre with its white-domed
                Sacré-Cœur Basilica.

                Culturally, Paris is considered one of the great centers of European art and intellect. It is home to
                numerous museums, galleries, and theaters. The city also holds a central place in the world of fashion,
                with major fashion houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Louis Vuitton headquartered there, and events like
                Paris Fashion Week attracting international attention.

                Parisian cuisine is world-renowned, ranging from fine dining in Michelin-starred restaurants to simple
                pleasures like fresh baguettes, pastries, and coffee enjoyed at corner cafés. Wine and cheese are
                essential parts of daily life.

                The city's atmosphere combines historical elegance with modern vitality. Each of its districts, or
                arrondissements, has its own character—from the intellectual Left Bank and Latin Quarter to the stylish
                Marais and the grand Haussmann-era boulevards.

                Paris remains a symbol of beauty, romance, and culture, drawing millions of visitors every year who come
                to experience its timeless charm.
